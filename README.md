<I>Conduct Online Competitions</I>

e-contest portal is the only plateform that facilitates schools and colleges to organise or host any kind of competition virtually. Undoubtedly, this is a revolutionary contribution in the field of education. Organising any competition virtually and bringing the students altogether has never been easier before, but now it has become mandatory to do so via e-contest portal.
